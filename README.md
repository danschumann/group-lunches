Group Lunches

========

Because we didn't want our emails to be spammed, but we wanted to save time when ordering lunches at work.

New redesign works in LDAP or with mysql/sqlite/maybe postgres

Allows users to create account ( non ldap ) or log in and create lunches where everyone can vote on restaurants.

Then when everyone selects a place, you all put in food orders and it makes it easier than calling all of your co-workers.
